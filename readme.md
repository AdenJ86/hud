# HUD

### Specs

A "HUD" is a "head's up display." Create a sketch in which some discrete thing happens over and over again (say, a ball bounces off the edge of the canvas, or the user clicks the mouse, or whatever).

1. Display a counter on the screen, anywhere you like. Each time this thing happens, the counter should increment by 1.

2. Also on the screen, there should be a timer counting up, displaying the time elapsed since the sketch started running. To do this, use the ```Timer``` provided in the ```HUD``` repo.

### Instructions and hints
1. Fork this repo.

2. ```timer.js``` contains code for a reasonably robust timer. Please see the documentation in the comments for notes on how to use this.

3. You may use any code you wish—that you have developed for other projects, that you create for this one, that you adapt from the internet—to create the rest of your sketch.

4. Please note that ```sketch.js``` is totally minimal. I have included a line of code that creates a ```Timer``` in a ```timer``` variable, but you may decide that this need not belong in the top level of your sketch, but rather might best go inside another object that you create.

5. Please be sure to modify the ```index.html``` to import any additional files you create.
